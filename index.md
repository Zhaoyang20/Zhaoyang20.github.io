## [My Resume](https://github.com/Zhaoyang20/Zhaoyang20.github.io/blob/master/CV_ZhaoyangZhang_Tsinghua.pdf)

Hi! I'm Zhaoyang Zhang, a senior student at the department of Aerospace Engineering, Tsinghua University. I was a visiting student of the [CFD Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/ucsbcfdlab/home/) at UCSB in 2019 summer, advised by [Prof. Eckart Meiburg](https://me.ucsb.edu/people/eckart-meiburg). At Tsinghua, I work as a student researcher at the Turbulence Lab under the guidance of [Prof. Lihao Zhao](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/hyen/1694/2016/20160906105643145637551/20160906105643145637551_.html).

I'm interested in understanding fundamental mechanisms of multiphase, interfacial and geophysical flows via high-resolution numerical simulations.

### Education Background

* Aerospace Engineering, Tsinghua University(2016-2020)
* GPA: 3.62/4.0, Ranking: 14/60

### Research Experiences

#### 1. Instability in double-diffusive fingering regime, 07/2019-09/2019
* Designed a 2D numerical configuration of rainwater layer over seawater, connected by a diffusive interface 
* Conducted direct numerical simulations with different combinations of parameter via adapted flow solver PARTIES (developed by CFD lab)
* Observed Rayleigh-Taylor(RT) instability and double-diffusive(DD) salt fingers. Explored 1D analytical solution for explanation of the observed phenomenon 
* Studied the effects of density ratio and diffusivity ratio on quantitative characteristics of mixed layer created by RT and DD fingers 
* Currently summing up results and have a paper in preparation

#### 2. Aerodynamic characteristics of aircraft with complex shape, 07/2018-10/2018
* Explored Riemann problem analytical solution for 1-dimensional situation 
* Established 3D unstructured mesh using ICEM CFD and completed simulation for cases with different parameters (velocity, altitude) in ANSYS FLUENT 
* Visualized the evolution characteristics of flow field (streamlines,pressure,etc.) by recording and playing macro commands in TECPLOT
* Analyzed how the important parameters (flying velocity, altitude, etc.) influenced the direction of airflow in aircraft windshield accidents

#### 3. Acoustic levitation of tiny particle influenced by fluid motion, 09/2018-07/2019
* Conducted literature review, studied the theory of acoustic levitation(or acoustophoresis), and investigated the development of applied device
* Fabricated a functional system including ultrasonic transducers and a driving board. Achieved stable levitation of Styrofoam bits and water droplets
* Designed models of different structures (curvature, transducer size) and conducted numerical simulation in COMSOL to achieve higher acoustic energy density

### Conference Presentation
Paper Presentation: "Direction of Airflow after the Break of an Aircraft Windshield" at IIT Madras, India
